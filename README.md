# Here's a basic explanation for readers to understand what's happening in the code:
This SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) probing script is designed to collect and analyze data from network devices. It can handle different types of data:

COUNTER32 and COUNTER64: These are like odometers, always increasing. The script calculates how fast they're changing.
GAUGE: Think of this as a speedometer. It shows current values and how much they've changed since the last check.
OCTET_STRING: This is just text data, which the script displays as-is.

The script does the following:

Regularly sends requests to a specified network device (every 0.1 to 10 seconds).
Collects data for multiple items (OIDs) in one go.
Processes the received data based on its type:

For counters, it calculates the rate of change.
For gauges, it shows the current value and the change.
For strings, it simply displays the text.


Handles potential issues like the device not responding or restarting.
Outputs the processed data in a specific format, showing a timestamp and values for each item.

This script is useful for monitoring network performance, tracking changes in various metrics, and collecting string data from network devices. It's flexible enough to handle different data types simultaneously, making it a versatile tool for network administrators and engineers.
